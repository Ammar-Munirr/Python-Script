2- The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100.

4- Based on your guess, the program will provide feedback:
    If your guess is higher than the secret number, it will display "Upper...".
    If your guess is lower than the secret number, it will display "Lower...".
    If your guess is correct, it will display "Congrats" and the total number of attempts.
    Continue guessing until you find the correct number.
